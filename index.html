  <p>Progressive Enhancement in my opinion makes total sense. Essentially you are separating your web development into parts. First HTML, Next CSS, and last
  your Java Script. To me this is a good idea because it creates step-based system. You don't bake a cake using every ingredient at one time, you split it into 
  parts. With progressive enhancement you focus on the content and eventually get to the decoration. Content first means you aren't losing any of your valuable
  information. The information is the most important part of a webpage. Why else would someone want to use it anyway? No one goes to a website to see how pretty
  the words are or how pretty the animations are. In my opinion Progressive Enhancement makes the most sense when building your webpage.

<p>This project was difficult for me at first to say the least. Maybe it was because I was nervous on where to begin. As I started piecing things together using the help of some example’s things got easier. I really enjoyed the process of making these web pages and I am quite proud of the outcome.
	I didn’t add much to my revision. I was told to clean it up a bit so moved some things around a little to make It look tighter and less bunched up on the page. Along with an extra picture and a couple of facts. I think it looked clean at the end. I did struggle with the spacing of some things. I have found that I have a bit of trouble identifying certain elements in my code once I have things written. Even when I add comments it looks a bit like alphabet soup. 
	Overall, this class has taught me a lot even though I had a pretty big rough patch this semester I look forward to delving deeper into the world of web development. The sense of accomplishment when you get something that has been giving you trouble finally works is indescribable to me. I really don’t get excited about much, but when something clicks while writing code and problem solving it gives me a feeling that I rarely feel. 
	My goal for Christmas break is to build myself a website to start displaying my artwork, and I am also interested in coming up with a potential clothing line featuring some of my pieces. The skills learned here are extremely valuable and I plan on practicing them and using them for the entirety of my career in computer science. Thank you, Mr. Wallace, for this opportunity and I look forward to learning more from you in the future. I hope you have a relaxing and safe Winter break. Happy holidays to you and your family!
